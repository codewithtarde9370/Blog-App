## Description

HealthyBlogs is a React.js application created to practice advanced routing concepts like dynamic routing. This app also covers key React concepts, including mapping, passing routing parameters, and using the `find` function and `substring` method. 

In this project:
- Dynamic routing is implemented by creating views.
- Only the Home view is created as of now.
- All necessary libraries are imported.
- A static array of blog data is created (in future projects, this data will be user-generated with backend support).

The project demonstrates how to display blog content in a card format by creating a reusable blog component. It also showcases the use of destructuring in React components.

## Features

- Dynamic routing with React Router
- Display blogs in a card format
- Home view with a list of blog cards
- Detailed blog view using routing parameters
- Static data array for blogs
